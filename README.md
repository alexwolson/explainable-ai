# Explainable AI Tutorial Materials

## Overview

This tutorial provides a deep dive into techniques for understanding, interpreting, and ensuring fairness in complex AI models, especially those considered "black boxes."

## Repository Contents

This repository contains all the materials needed for the XAI tutorial, including links to interactive Colab notebooks for hands-on exercises.

### Links to Colab Notebooks
- [Mini Lab 1: SHAP](https://colab.research.google.com/github/alexwolson/explainable-ai/blob/main/mini_lab_1.ipynb): Learn about SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability.
- [Mini Lab 2: LIME](https://colab.research.google.com/github/alexwolson/explainable-ai/blob/main/mini_lab_2.ipynb): Explore LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) for understanding individual predictions.
- [Mini Lab 3: CP and PDP](https://colab.research.google.com/github/alexwolson/explainable-ai/blob/main/mini_lab_3.ipynb): Dive into Ceteris Paribus (CP) and Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) for visualizing model behavior.
- [Mini Lab 4: Fairness](https://colab.research.google.com/github/alexwolson/explainable-ai/blob/main/mini_lab_4.ipynb): Understand and apply techniques to ensure fairness in AI models.
